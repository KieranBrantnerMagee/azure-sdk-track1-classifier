In this quickstart, you'll create a Java app to send messages to and receive messages from an Azure Service Bus queue.

 Important

This quickstart uses the new azure-messaging-servicebus package. For a quickstart that uses the old azure-servicebus package, see Send and receive messages using azure-servicebus.

Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. You can activate your MSDN subscriber benefits or sign up for a free account.
If you don't have a queue to work with, follow steps in the Use Azure portal to create a Service Bus queue article to create a queue. Note down the connection string for your Service Bus namespace and the name of the queue you created.
Install Azure SDK for Java. If you're using Eclipse, you can install the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse that includes the Azure SDK for Java. You can then add the Microsoft Azure Libraries for Java to your project. If you're using IntelliJ, see Install the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ.
Send messages to a queue
In this section, you'll create a Java console project, and add code to send messages to the queue that you created earlier.

Create a Java console project
Create a Java project using Eclipse or a tool of your choice.

Configure your application to use Service Bus
Add a reference to Azure Service Bus library. The Java client library for Service Bus is available in the Maven Central Repository. You can reference this library using the following dependency declaration inside your Maven project file:

XML

Copy
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-messaging-servicebus</artifactId>
    <version>7.0.0</version>
</dependency>
Add code to send messages to the queue
Add the following import statements at the topic of the Java file.

Java

Copy
import com.azure.messaging.servicebus.*;
import com.azure.messaging.servicebus.models.*;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.function.Consumer;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
In the class, define variables to hold connection string and queue name as shown below:

Java

Copy
static String connectionString = "<NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING>";
static String queueName = "<QUEUE NAME>";    
Replace <NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING> with the connection string to your Service Bus namespace. And, replace <QUEUE NAME> with the name of the queue.

Add a method named sendMessage in the class to send one message to the queue.

Java

Copy
static void sendMessage()
{
    // create a Service Bus Sender client for the queue 
    ServiceBusSenderClient senderClient = new ServiceBusClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(connectionString)
            .sender()
            .queueName(queueName)
            .buildClient();

    // send one message to the queue
    senderClient.sendMessage(new ServiceBusMessage("Hello, World!"));
    System.out.println("Sent a single message to the queue: " + queueName);        
}
Add a method named createMessages in the class to create a list of messages. Typically, you get these messages from different parts of your application. Here, we create a list of sample messages.

Java

Copy
static List<ServiceBusMessage> createMessages()
{
    // create a list of messages and return it to the caller
    ServiceBusMessage[] messages = {
    		new ServiceBusMessage("First message"),
    		new ServiceBusMessage("Second message"),
    		new ServiceBusMessage("Third message")
    };
    return Arrays.asList(messages);
}
Add a method named sendMessageBatch method to send messages to the queue you created. This method creates a ServiceBusSenderClient for the queue, invokes the createMessages method to get the list of messages, prepares one or more batches, and sends the batches to the queue.

Java

Copy
    static void sendMessageBatch()
    {
        // create a Service Bus Sender client for the queue 
        ServiceBusSenderClient senderClient = new ServiceBusClientBuilder()
                .connectionString(connectionString)
                .sender()
                .queueName(queueName)
                .buildClient();

        // Creates an ServiceBusMessageBatch where the ServiceBus.
        ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = senderClient.createMessageBatch();        
        
    	// create a list of messages
        List<ServiceBusMessage> listOfMessages = createMessages();
        
        // We try to add as many messages as a batch can fit based on the maximum size and send to Service Bus when
        // the batch can hold no more messages. Create a new batch for next set of messages and repeat until all
        // messages are sent.        
        for (ServiceBusMessage message : listOfMessages) {
            if (messageBatch.tryAddMessage(message)) {
                continue;
            }

            // The batch is full, so we create a new batch and send the batch.
            senderClient.sendMessages(messageBatch);
            System.out.println("Sent a batch of messages to the queue: " + queueName);
            
            // create a new batch
            messageBatch = senderClient.createMessageBatch();

            // Add that message that we couldn't before.
            if (!messageBatch.tryAddMessage(message)) {
                System.err.printf("Message is too large for an empty batch. Skipping. Max size: %s.", messageBatch.getMaxSizeInBytes());
            }
        }
        
        if (messageBatch.getCount() > 0) {
            senderClient.sendMessages(messageBatch);
            System.out.println("Sent a batch of messages to the queue: " + queueName);
        }

        //close the client
        senderClient.close();
    }
Receive messages from a queue
In this section, you'll add code to retrieve messages from the queue.

Add a method named receiveMessages to receive messages from the queue. This method creates a ServiceBusProcessorClient for the queue by specifying a handler for processing messages and another one for handling errors. Then, it starts the processor, waits for few seconds, prints the messages that are received, and then stops and closes the processor.

Java

Copy
// handles received messages
static void receiveMessages() throws InterruptedException
{
    // consumer that processes a single message received from Service Bus
    Consumer<ServiceBusReceivedMessageContext> messageProcessor = context -> {
        ServiceBusReceivedMessage message = context.getMessage();
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message.getBody().toString());
    };

    // handles any errors that occur when receiving messages
    Consumer<Throwable> errorHandler = throwable -> {
        System.out.println("Error when receiving messages: " + throwable.getMessage());
        if (throwable instanceof ServiceBusReceiverException) {
            ServiceBusReceiverException serviceBusReceiverException = (ServiceBusReceiverException) throwable;
            System.out.println("Error source: " + serviceBusReceiverException.getErrorSource());
        }
    };

    // create an instance of the processor through the ServiceBusClientBuilder
    ServiceBusProcessorClient processorClient = new ServiceBusClientBuilder()
        .connectionString(connectionString)
        .processor()
        .queueName(queueName)
        .processMessage(messageProcessor)
        .processError(errorHandler)
        .buildProcessorClient();

    System.out.println("Starting the processor");
    processorClient.start();

    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(10);
    System.out.println("Stopping and closing the processor");
    processorClient.close();    	
}    
Update the main method to invoke sendMessage, sendMessageBatch, and receiveMessages methods and to throw InterruptedException.

Java

Copy
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {    	
    sendMessage();
	sendMessageBatch();
	receiveMessages();
}   
Run the app
When you run the application, you see the following messages in the console window.

Console

Copy
Sent a single message to the queue: myqueue
Sent a batch of messages to the queue: myqueue
Starting the processor
Received message: Hello, World!
Received message: First message in the batch
Received message: Second message in the batch
Received message: Three message in the batch
Stopping and closing the processor
On the Overview page for the Service Bus namespace in the Azure portal, you can see incoming and outgoing message count. You may need to wait for a minute or so and then refresh the page to see the latest values.

Incoming and outgoing message count

Select the queue on this Overview page to navigate to the Service Bus Queue page. You see the incoming and outgoing message count on this page too. You also see other information such as the current size of the queue, maximum size, active message count, and so on.
