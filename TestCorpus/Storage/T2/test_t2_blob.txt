In this tutorial, you create a .NET Core console application to send messages to and receive messages from a Service Bus queue using the Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus package.

 Important

This quickstart uses the new Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus package. For a quickstart that uses the old Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus package, see Send and receive events using Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus package.

Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019
An Azure subscription. To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. You can activate your MSDN subscriber benefits or sign up for a free account.
If you don't have a queue to work with, follow steps in the Use Azure portal to create a Service Bus queue article to create a queue. Note down the connection string for your Service Bus namespace and the name of the queue you created.
Send messages to a queue
In this quick start, you'll create a C# .NET Core console application to send messages to the queue.

Create a console application
Launch Visual Studio and create a new Console App (.NET Core) project for C#.

Add the Service Bus NuGet package
Right-click the newly created project and select Manage NuGet Packages.
Select Browse. Search for and select Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.
Select Install to complete the installation, then close the NuGet Package Manager.
Add code to send messages to the queue
In Program.cs, add the following using statements at the top of the namespace definition, before the class declaration:

C#

Copy
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
In the Program class, declare the following variables:

C#

Copy
    static string connectionString = "<NAMESPACE CONNECTION STRING>";
    static string queueName = "<QUEUE NAME>";
Enter your connection string for the namespace as the ServiceBusConnectionString variable. Enter your queue name.

Replace the Main() method with the following async Main method. It calls the SendMessagesAsync() method that you will add in the next step to send messages to the queue.

C#

Copy
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{    
    const int numberOfMessages = 10;

    Console.WriteLine("======================================================");
    Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER key to exit after sending all the messages.");
    Console.WriteLine("======================================================");

    // Send messages.
    await SendMessagesAsync(numberOfMessages);

    Console.ReadKey();
}
Directly after the Main() method, add the following SendMessagesAsync() method that does the work of sending the number of messages specified by numberOfMessagesToSend (currently set to 10):

C#

Copy
    static async Task SendMessageAsync()
    {
        // create a Service Bus client 
        await using (ServiceBusClient client = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString))
        {
            // create a sender for the queue 
            ServiceBusSender sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);

            // create a message that we can send
            ServiceBusMessage message = new ServiceBusMessage("Hello world!");

            // send the message
            await sender.SendMessageAsync(message);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sent a single message to the queue: {queueName}");
        }
    }
Add a method named CreateMessages to create a queue (.NET queue) of messages to the Program class. Typically, you get these messages from different parts of your application. Here, we create a queue of sample messages.

C#

Copy
    static Queue<ServiceBusMessage> CreateMessages()
    {
        // create a queue containing the messages and return it to the caller
        Queue<ServiceBusMessage> messages = new Queue<ServiceBusMessage>();
        messages.Enqueue(new ServiceBusMessage("First message"));
        messages.Enqueue(new ServiceBusMessage("Second message"));
        messages.Enqueue(new ServiceBusMessage("Third message"));
        return messages;
    }
Add a method named SendMessageBatchAsync to the Program class, and add the following code. This method takes a queue of messages, and prepares one or more batches to send to the Service Bus queue.

C#

Copy
    static async Task SendMessageBatchAsync()
    {
        // create a Service Bus client 
        await using (ServiceBusClient client = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString))
        {
            // create a sender for the queue 
            ServiceBusSender sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);

            // get the messages to be sent to the Service Bus queue
            Queue<ServiceBusMessage> messages = CreateMessages();

            // total number of messages to be sent to the Service Bus queue
            int messageCount = messages.Count;

            // while all messages are not sent to the Service Bus queue
            while (messages.Count > 0)
            {
                // start a new batch 
                using ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = await sender.CreateMessageBatchAsync();

                // add the first message to the batch
                if (messageBatch.TryAddMessage(messages.Peek()))
                {
                    // dequeue the message from the .NET queue once the message is added to the batch
                    messages.Dequeue();
                }
                else
                {
                    // if the first message can't fit, then it is too large for the batch
                    throw new Exception($"Message {messageCount - messages.Count} is too large and cannot be sent.");
                }

                // add as many messages as possible to the current batch
                while (messages.Count > 0 && messageBatch.TryAddMessage(messages.Peek()))
                {
                    // dequeue the message from the .NET queue as it has been added to the batch
                    messages.Dequeue();
                }

                // now, send the batch
                await sender.SendMessagesAsync(messageBatch);

                // if there are any remaining messages in the .NET queue, the while loop repeats 
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"Sent a batch of {messageCount} messages to the topic: {queueName}");
        }
    }
Replace the Main() method with the following async Main method. It calls both the send methods to send a single message and a batch of messages to the queue.

C#

Copy
    static async Task Main()
    {
        // send a message to the queue
        await SendMessageAsync();

        // send a batch of messages to the queue
        await SendMessageBatchAsync();
    }
Run the application. You should see the following messages.

Console

Copy
Sent a single message to the queue: myqueue
Sent a batch of messages to the queue: myqueue
In the Azure portal, follow these steps:

Navigate to your Service Bus namespace.
On the Overview page, select the queue in the bottom-middle pane.
Notice the values in the Essentials section.
Messages received with count and size

Notice the following values:

The Active message count value for the queue is now 4. Each time you run this sender app without retrieving the messages, this value increases by 4.
The current size of the queue increments the CURRENT value in Essentials each time the app adds messages to the queue.
In the Messages chart in the bottom Metrics section, you can see that there are four incoming messages for the queue.
Receive messages from a queue
In this section, you'll add code to retrieve messages from the queue.

Add the following methods to the Program class that handle messages and any errors.

C#

Copy
    // handle received messages
    static async Task MessageHandler(ProcessMessageEventArgs args)
    {
        string body = args.Message.Body.ToString();
        Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");

        // complete the message. messages is deleted from the queue. 
        await args.CompleteMessageAsync(args.Message);
    }

    // handle any errors when receiving messages
    static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
Add a method named ReceiveMessagesAsync to the Program class, and add the following code to receive messages.

C#

Copy
    static async Task ReceiveMessagesAsync()
    {
        await using (ServiceBusClient client = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString))
        {
            // create a processor that we can use to process the messages
            ServiceBusProcessor processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());

            // add handler to process messages
            processor.ProcessMessageAsync += MessageHandler;

            // add handler to process any errors
            processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ErrorHandler;

            // start processing 
            await processor.StartProcessingAsync();

            Console.WriteLine("Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing");
            Console.ReadKey();

            // stop processing 
            Console.WriteLine("\nStopping the receiver...");
            await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Stopped receiving messages");
        }
    }
Add a call to ReceiveMessagesAsync method from the Main method. Comment out the SendMessagesAsync method if you want to test only receiving of messages. If you don't, you see another four messages sent to the queue.

C#

Copy
    static async Task Main()
    {
        // send a message to the queue
        await SendMessageAsync();

        // send a batch of messages to the queue
        await SendMessageBatchAsync();

        // receive message from the queue
        await ReceiveMessagesAsync();
    }
Run the app
Run the application. Wait for a minute and then press any key to stop receiving messages. You should see the following output (spacebar for the key).

Console

Copy
Sent a single message to the queue: myqueue
Sent a batch of messages to the queue: myqueue
Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing
Received: Hello world!
Received: First message in the batch
Received: Second message in the batch
Received: Third message in the batch
Received: Hello world!
Received: First message in the batch
Received: Second message in the batch
Received: Third message in the batch

Stopping the receiver...
Stopped receiving messages
Check the portal again.

The Active message count and CURRENT values are now 0.

In the Messages chart in the bottom Metrics section, you can see that there are eight incoming messages and eight outgoing messages for the queue.
