8 minutes to read
  
This quickstart shows how to send events to and receive events from an event hub using the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs .NET Core library.

 Warning

This quickstart uses the old Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs package. For a quickstart that uses the latest Azure.Messaging.EventHubs library, see Send and receive events using Azure.Messaging.EventHubs library. To move your application from using the old library to new one, see the Guide to migrate from Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs to Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.

Prerequisites
If you are new to Azure Event Hubs, see Event Hubs overview before you do this quickstart.

To complete this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

Microsoft Azure subscription. To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you need a subscription. If you don't have an existing Azure account, you can sign up for a free trial or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you create an account.
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
.NET Core Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 tools.
Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub. The first step is to use the Azure portal to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in this article. Then, get the connection string for the event hub namespace by following instructions from the article: Get connection string. You use the connection string later in this quickstart.
Send events
This section shows you how to create a .NET Core console application to send events to an event hub.

 Note

You can download this quickstart as a sample from the GitHub, replace EventHubConnectionString and EventHubName strings with your event hub values, and run it. Alternatively, you can follow the steps in this quickstart to create your own.

Create a console application
Start Visual Studio. From the File menu, click New, and then click Project. Create a .NET Core console application.

New project

Add the Event Hubs NuGet package
Add the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs .NET Core library NuGet package to your project by following these steps:

Right-click the newly created project and select Manage NuGet Packages.
Click the Browse tab, then search for "Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs" and select the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs package. Click Install to complete the installation, then close this dialog box.
Write code to send messages to the event hub
Add the following using statements to the top of the Program.cs file:

C#

Copy
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
Add constants to the Program class for the Event Hubs connection string and entity path (individual event hub name). Replace the placeholders in brackets with the proper values that were obtained when creating the event hub. Make sure that the {Event Hubs connection string} is the namespace-level connection string, and not the event hub string.

C#

Copy
private static EventHubClient eventHubClient;
private const string EventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hubs connection string}";
private const string EventHubName = "{Event Hub path/name}";
Add a new method named MainAsync to the Program class, as follows:

C#

Copy
private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
{
    // Creates an EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder object from the connection string, and sets the EntityPath.
    // Typically, the connection string should have the entity path in it, but this simple scenario
    // uses the connection string from the namespace.
    var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(EventHubConnectionString)
    {
        EntityPath = EventHubName
    };

    eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());

    await SendMessagesToEventHub(100);

    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();

    Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to exit.");
    Console.ReadLine();
}
Add a new method named SendMessagesToEventHub to the Program class, as follows:

C#

Copy
// Uses the event hub client to send 100 messages to the event hub.
private static async Task SendMessagesToEventHub(int numMessagesToSend)
{
    for (var i = 0; i < numMessagesToSend; i++)
    {
        try
        {
            var message = $"Message {i}";
            Console.WriteLine($"Sending message: {message}");
            await eventHubClient.SendAsync(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)));
        }
        catch (Exception exception)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now} > Exception: {exception.Message}");
        }

        await Task.Delay(10);
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"{numMessagesToSend} messages sent.");
}
Add the following code to the Main method in the Program class:

C#

Copy
MainAsync(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
Here is what your Program.cs should look like.

C#

Copy
 namespace SampleSender
 {
     using System;
     using System.Text;
     using System.Threading.Tasks;
     using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;

     public class Program
     {
         private static EventHubClient eventHubClient;
         private const string EventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hubs connection string}";
         private const string EventHubName = "{Event Hub path/name}";

         public static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             MainAsync(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
         }

         private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
         {
             // Creates an EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder object from the connection string, and sets the EntityPath.
             // Typically, the connection string should have the entity path in it, but for the sake of this simple scenario
             // we are using the connection string from the namespace.
             var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(EventHubConnectionString)
             {
                 EntityPath = EventHubName
             };

             eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());

             await SendMessagesToEventHub(100);

             await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();

             Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to exit.");
             Console.ReadLine();
         }

         // Uses the event hub client to send 100 messages to the event hub.
         private static async Task SendMessagesToEventHub(int numMessagesToSend)
         {
             for (var i = 0; i < numMessagesToSend; i++)
             {
                 try
                 {
                     var message = $"Message {i}";
                     Console.WriteLine($"Sending message: {message}");
                     await eventHubClient.SendAsync(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)));
                 }
                 catch (Exception exception)
                 {
                     Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now} > Exception: {exception.Message}");
                 }

                 await Task.Delay(10);
             }

             Console.WriteLine($"{numMessagesToSend} messages sent.");
         }
     }
 }
Run the program, and ensure that there are no errors.

Receive events
This section shows how to write a .NET Core console application that receives messages from an event hub using the Event Processor Host. The Event Processor Host is a .NET class that simplifies receiving events from event hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives from those event hubs. Using the Event Processor Host, you can split events across multiple receivers, even when hosted in different nodes. This example shows how to use the Event Processor Host for a single receiver.

 Note

You can download this quickstart as a sample from the GitHub, replace EventHubConnectionString and EventHubName, StorageAccountName, StorageAccountKey, and StorageContainerName strings with your event hub values, and run it. Alternatively, you can follow the steps in this tutorial to create your own.

Create a storage account for Event Processor Host
The Event Processor Host is an intelligent agent that simplifies receiving events from Event Hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives. For checkpointing, the Event Processor Host requires a storage account. The following example shows how to create a storage account and how to get its keys for access:

From the Azure portal menu, select Create a resource.

Create a resource menu item, Microsoft Azure portal

Select Storage > Storage account.

Select Storage account, Microsoft Azure portal

On the Create storage account page, take the following steps:

Enter the Storage account name.

Choose an Azure Subscription that contains the event hub.

Choose or create the Resource group that has the event hub.

Pick a Location in which to create the resource.

Select Review + create.

Review + create, Create storage account, Microsoft Azure portal

On the Review + create page, review the values, and select Create.

Review storage account settings and create, Microsoft Azure portal

After you see the Deployments Succeeded message in your notifications, select Go to resource to open the Storage Account page. Alternatively, you can expand Deployment details and then select your new resource from the resource list.

Go to resource, storage account deployment, Microsoft Azure portal

Select Containers.

Select the Blobs container service, storage accounts, Microsoft Azure portal

Select + Container at the top, enter a Name for the container, and select OK.

Create a new blob container, storage accounts, Microsoft Azure portal

Choose Access keys from the Storage account page menu, and copy the value of key1.

Save the following values to Notepad or some other temporary location.

Name of the storage account
Access key for the storage account
Name of the container
Create a console application
Start Visual Studio. From the File menu, click New, and then click Project. Create a .NET Core console application.

New project for receive

Add the Event Hubs NuGet package
Add the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs and Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor .NET Standard library NuGet packages to your project by following these steps:

Right-click the newly created project and select Manage NuGet Packages.
Click the Browse tab, search for Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs, and then select the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs package. Click Install to complete the installation, then close this dialog box.
Repeat steps 1 and 2, and install the Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor package.
Implement the IEventProcessor interface
In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, click Add, and then click Class. Name the new class SimpleEventProcessor.

Open the SimpleEventProcessor.cs file and add the following using statements to the top of the file.

C#

Copy
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor;
 using System.Threading.Tasks;
Implement the IEventProcessor interface. Replace the entire contents of the SimpleEventProcessor class with the following code:

C#

Copy
public class SimpleEventProcessor : IEventProcessor
{
    public Task CloseAsync(PartitionContext context, CloseReason reason)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processor Shutting Down. Partition '{context.PartitionId}', Reason: '{reason}'.");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OpenAsync(PartitionContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"SimpleEventProcessor initialized. Partition: '{context.PartitionId}'");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task ProcessErrorAsync(PartitionContext context, Exception error)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error on Partition: {context.PartitionId}, Error: {error.Message}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task ProcessEventsAsync(PartitionContext context, IEnumerable<EventData> messages)
    {
        foreach (var eventData in messages)
        {
            var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body.Array, eventData.Body.Offset, eventData.Body.Count);
            Console.WriteLine($"Message received. Partition: '{context.PartitionId}', Data: '{data}'");
        }

        return context.CheckpointAsync();
    }
}
Update the Main method to use SimpleEventProcessor
Add the following using statements to the top of the Program.cs file.

C#

Copy
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor;
 using System.Threading.Tasks;
Add constants to the Program class for the event hub connection string, event hub name, storage account container name, storage account name, and storage account key. Add the following code, replacing the placeholders with their corresponding values:

C#

Copy
private const string EventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hubs connection string}";
private const string EventHubName = "{Event Hub path/name}";
private const string StorageContainerName = "{Storage account container name}";
private const string StorageAccountName = "{Storage account name}";
private const string StorageAccountKey = "{Storage account key}";

private static readonly string StorageConnectionString = string.Format("DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={0};AccountKey={1}", StorageAccountName, StorageAccountKey);
Add a new method named MainAsync to the Program class, as follows:

C#

Copy
private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Registering EventProcessor...");

    var eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(
        EventHubName,
        PartitionReceiver.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
        EventHubConnectionString,
        StorageConnectionString,
        StorageContainerName);

    // Registers the Event Processor Host and starts receiving messages
    await eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync<SimpleEventProcessor>();

    Console.WriteLine("Receiving. Press ENTER to stop worker.");
    Console.ReadLine();

    // Disposes of the Event Processor Host
    await eventProcessorHost.UnregisterEventProcessorAsync();
}
Add the following line of code to the Main method:

C#

Copy
MainAsync(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
Here is what your Program.cs file should look like:

C#

Copy
namespace SampleEphReceiver
{

    public class Program
    {
        private const string EventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hubs connection string}";
        private const string EventHubName = "{Event Hub path/name}";
        private const string StorageContainerName = "{Storage account container name}";
        private const string StorageAccountName = "{Storage account name}";
        private const string StorageAccountKey = "{Storage account key}";

        private static readonly string StorageConnectionString = string.Format("DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={0};AccountKey={1}", StorageAccountName, StorageAccountKey);

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MainAsync(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
        }

        private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Registering EventProcessor...");

            var eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(
                EventHubName,
                PartitionReceiver.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
                EventHubConnectionString,
                StorageConnectionString,
                StorageContainerName);

            // Registers the Event Processor Host and starts receiving messages
            await eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync<SimpleEventProcessor>();

            Console.WriteLine("Receiving. Press ENTER to stop worker.");
            Console.ReadLine();

            // Disposes of the Event Processor Host
            await eventProcessorHost.UnregisterEventProcessorAsync();
        }
    }
}
Run the program, and ensure that there are no errors.
